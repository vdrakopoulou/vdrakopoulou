# Dr. Veliota Drakopoulou

**Finance & AI Researcher | Natural Language Processing | Algorithmic Trading | ESG Analytics | Portfolio Optimization**

I develop transparent, Python-based research pipelines that integrate financial econometrics, machine learning, and text analytics to study market behavior in the UAE and global markets. My work focuses on advancing reproducible finance research using free and synthetic datasets, modern NLP models, and scalable portfolio analytics.

## Research Areas
- **NLP for ESG and Financial Disclosures**  
  FinBERT, AraBERT, sentiment modeling, credibility scoring, event windows.

- **Algorithmic Trading & Market Microstructure**  
  Liquidity shocks, micro-volatility bursts, high-frequency signals, synthetic order-flow data.

- **Portfolio Construction & Optimization**  
  CAPM, factor models, CVXPY optimization, CVaR, DRO, technical indicators, deep learning frameworks.

- **UAE Market Research (ADX & DFM)**  
  Retail flows, ESG events, macro-finance interactions, sectoral heterogeneity, Python-based pipelines.

## Current Projects
- **NLP of ESG Disclosures (ADX & DFM)**  
  Event-study pipeline using FinBERT/AraBERT sentiment + abnormal retail flows.

- **Deep Learning for Portfolio Allocation**  
  LSTM, transformers, stochastic optimization, risk-sensitive rebalancing.

- **Algorithmic Trading Pressure and Liquidity Bursts**  
  Synthetic limit-order-book simulation and microstructure metrics.

- **Python-Assisted Finance Education**  
  ChatGPT-guided coding labs, reproducible teaching modules, ADX-focused student projects.

## Code & Repositories
This GitHub contains reproducible examples, synthetic datasets, Jupyter notebooks, and full research pipelines, including:

- `src/` modules for data collection, feature engineering, and model estimation  
- `notebooks/` for exploratory analysis, event windows, and model diagnostics  
- `data/` structure for raw, interim, and processed datasets  
- `results/` with tables, figures, and replication files  

Each repository includes a **config.yaml**, unit tests, and Markdown documentation for transparency.
